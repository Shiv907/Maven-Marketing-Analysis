## Task: 

The challenge requires assuming the role of a newly-hired BI consultant for Maven Marketing, a small digital marketing agency. Their latest marketing campaigns have underperformed, and they have brought you in to analyze their data and propose a solution. <br>

Our task was to pitch a #1 recommendation to improve the impact of future marketing campaigns and show the analysis to support it. <br>
